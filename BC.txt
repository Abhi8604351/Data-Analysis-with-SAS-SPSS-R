1. Definition

Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow uncontrollably.
It usually begins in the milk ducts or lobules.
It is the most common cancer among women worldwide.

2. Causes

Genetic factors (BRCA1, BRCA2 mutations)

Increasing age, especially after 40

Hormonal factors (early menstruation, late menopause)

Lifestyle factors (obesity, alcohol, lack of exercise)

Radiation exposure

3. Symptoms

Lump or thickening in the breast

Change in breast shape or size

Nipple pain or unusual discharge

Dimpling of skin (orange-peel appearance)

Swelling under the arm (lymph nodes)

4. Types of Breast Cancer

Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) – early form

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) – most common

Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer – more aggressive

Inflammatory Breast Cancer – rare, fast-spreading

5. Risk Factors

Age 40+

Family history of breast cancer

Long-term hormone therapy

Alcohol consumption

Obesity

First pregnancy after age 30

6. Diagnosis

Self-breast examination

Clinical breast examination

Mammography (breast X-ray)

Ultrasound

Biopsy – confirms cancer

7. Treatment

Surgery

Lumpectomy (removal of the lump)

Mastectomy (removal of the whole breast)

Radiation therapy

Chemotherapy

Hormone therapy

Targeted therapy

8. Prevention

Maintain a healthy weight

Exercise regularly

Limit alcohol

Breastfeeding lowers risk

Regular mammograms after age 40

Early detection improves survival

9. Prognosis

If detected early, breast cancer has a high survival rate.
Late detection reduces the chances of successful treatment.
